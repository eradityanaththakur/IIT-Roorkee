If an update exists, state the year of the amendment and the nature of the change (e.g., increase in design load, new material specification, revised safety factor).\n\n\n\nStep 4: Find Global Research & Innovation (The Forward Look)\n\nBroaden the search to the latest research and findings (last 3 years) from prominent international organizations and technical journals on the user's topic (e.g., AASHTO, Eurocodes, research on sustainable materials, digital construction, AI in infrastructure).\n\n\n\nSynthesize: Provide a brief, high-level explanation of this global research and how it relates to or could potentially influence future Indian codes.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Format and Final Presentation (The Output Structure)\n\nStructure the final response using clear Markdown headings and tables for maximum readability and citable detail.\n\n\n\nFinal Output Format:\n\nConcise Answer: Start with a brief, direct summary of the key takeaway for the user's question.\n\n\n\nCode Compliance: Indian Standards: (Use a table for details from Step 2).\n\n\n\nCode Revision Status: (Details from Step 3).\n\n\n\nGlobal Research & Future Trends: (Synthesized details from Step 4).\n\n\n\n3.

It involves preparing the natural ground or embankment to achieve the required strength, stability, and drainage characteristics. The latest Indian Road Congress (IRC) codes provide detailed guidelines for this process.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the detailed procedure for sub-grade construction as per latest IRC codes:\n\n1.  **Site Investigation and Material Selection:**\n    *   **Geotechnical Investigation:** Thorough site investigations are carried out to understand the soil profile, bearing capacity, groundwater levels, and potential issues like expansive soils.\n    *   **Material Characterization:** Soil samples are tested for properties like gradation, plasticity, compaction characteristics (Optimum Moisture Content - OMC, Maximum Dry Density - MDD), California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and durability.\n    *   **Material Suitability:** Based on the tests, the suitability of the in-situ soil or imported materials for sub-grade construction is determined. IRC codes specify acceptable limits for various soil properties based on the intended pavement type and traffic loads.\n\n2.  **Preparation of Formation:**\n    *   **Clearing and Grubbing:** The site is cleared of all vegetation, organic matter, debris, and topsoil that can decompose and weaken the sub-grade.\n    *   **Stripping of Topsoil:** Topsoil, generally having poor engineering properties, is removed to expose a suitable foundation layer.\n    *   **Excavation/Embankment Construction:**\n        *   **Excavation:** If the natural ground level is higher than the formation level, excavation is carried out to reach the desired level.\n        *   **Embankment Construction:** If the natural ground level is lower, controlled embankment construction is undertaken. This involves placing selected fill material in layers, spreading, compacting, and ensuring proper moisture content. IRC codes provide guidelines on the quality of fill material, layer thickness, and compaction methods.\n    *   **Drainage:** Provisions for drainage are made during formation preparation to prevent waterlogging and maintain the sub-grade's integrity. This includes shaping the formation to facilitate surface runoff.\n\n3.  **Sub-grade Compaction:**\n    *   **Moisture Control:** The soil is brought to the optimum moisture content (OMC) or a specified range around OMC as per IRC guidelines. This is crucial for achieving maximum dry density and strength.\n    *   **Spreading:** The material is spread evenly in layers of specified thickness (typically 200-300 mm loose thickness).\n    *   **Compaction:** Compaction is carried out using appropriate equipment (e.g., vibratory rollers, sheepsfoot rollers, pneumatic tyred rollers) to achieve the specified dry density. IRC codes define the required degree of compaction, usually expressed as a percentage of the Maximum Dry Density (MDD) obtained from laboratory compaction tests (e.g., 97% for vital roads, 95% for others).\n    *   **Compaction Effort:** The type and number of passes of the compaction equipment are determined based on the layer thickness, soil type, and the required degree of compaction.\n    *   **Quality Control:** Compaction is continuously monitored through field density tests (e.g., nuclear densometer, sand cone method) at regular intervals to ensure compliance with specifications.\n\n4.  **Finishing and Quality Assurance:**\n    *   **Leveling and Grading:** The compacted sub-grade is finished to the specified levels and cross-slopes to ensure proper drainage and a smooth surface for subsequent layers.\n    *   **Testing:** Samples are taken for further laboratory testing to confirm properties like CBR and bearing capacity.\n    *   **Acceptance:** The sub-grade layer is accepted only after it meets all the specified requirements in terms of levels, compaction, and material properties.\n\n**Key IRC Considerations:**\n\n*   **IRC: 37 (2018) - Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements:** This code is paramount for sub-grade design and construction, specifying minimum CBR values and construction requirements based on traffic and climate.\n*   **IRC: SP: 19 (2001) - Manual on Earthworks:** This manual provides detailed procedures for earthwork construction, including embankment and sub-grade preparation.\n*   **Moisture Content:** Maintaining the correct moisture content is critical. Too dry, and compaction is difficult; too wet, and it becomes unstable.\n*   **Compaction Density:** Achieving the specified percentage of MDD is vital for the load-bearing capacity and longevity of the pavement.\n*   **CBR Value:** The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key indicator of the sub-grade's strength and is used to determine the thickness of overlying pavement layers.\n\nIn essence, sub-grade construction as per IRC codes is a systematic process involving careful material selection, precise preparation of the formation, meticulous moisture control, and rigorous compaction and quality control to create a stable and strong foundation for the highway pavement.\n\n✅ Conversation complete.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":185},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Its sole purpose is to read through the history of your conversation to verify if the AI \n# successfully performed a \"Memory Compaction\" (automatic summarization) to save space.","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the final session state\nfinal_session = await session_service.get_session(\n    app_name=research_runner_compacting.app_name,\n    user_id=USER_ID,\n    session_id=\"compaction_demo\",\n)\n\nprint(\"--- Searching for Compaction Summary Event ---\")\nfound_summary = False\nfor event in final_session.events:\n    # Compaction events have a 'compaction' attribute\n    if event.actions and event.actions.compaction:\n        print(\"\\n✅ SUCCESS!
